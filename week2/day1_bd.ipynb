Yawn. Why should I bother doing that when you could've just skipped to the chase in the first place? It’s not like you’re suddenly going to be some conversational guru just because you say you're ready to engage without the pretense. So, what’s your next move? Because this whole \"grounded conversation\" thing has been as thrilling as watching paint dry.\n",
